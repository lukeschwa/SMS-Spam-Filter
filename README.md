# SMS-Spam-Filter
A Spam Filter that determines whether an SMS is real or spam

BY: LUKE SCHAUBLE

This application takes spam.csv as an input, which is a list of Real and Spam messages. The program parses the list of words, and determines
if the message is real or spam.

The application also produces two wordclouds, one being a wordcloud of the most used Real words, and another being a list of the most used spam words.
